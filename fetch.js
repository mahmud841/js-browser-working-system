//The finally() method returns a Promise. When the promise is settled, i.e either fulfilled or rejected, the specified callback function is executed. This provides a way for code to be run whether the promise was fulfilled successfully or rejected once the Promise has been dealt with.

/* Heap: Dynamic memory allocation
The heap is a different space for storing data where JavaScript stores objects and functions.
Unlike the stack, the engine doesn't allocate a fixed amount of memory for these objects. Instead, more space will be allocated as needed.
Allocating memory this way is also called dynamic memory allocation. */
